## CS-305-Software-Security

***Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?***<br>
Artemis Financial is a financial planning company that develops individual financial plans for their customer such as savings, retirement, investments, and insurance plans. Due to the nature of their business Artemis financial wanted to have and effective software security system integrated onto their current system in order to protect the organization from external cyber security threats.

***What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?***<br>
Through the vulnerability assessment, I managed to capture potential threats as well as areas of security that needed to be addressed such as the use APIs in order to have a secure connection, cryptography in order to make sure only the intended recipient is the one accessing the data, as well as client/server connections.

It is important to code securely because this helps prevent security vulnerabilities and weaknesses that can be exploited by attackers, resulting in data breaches, loss of intellectual property, financial loss, and damage to a company's reputation. 

Investing in software security can help companies to mitigate risks, reduce costs, meet compliance requirements, and enhance customer trust and satisfaction, all of which contribute to a company's overall wellbeing.

***What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?***<br>
The most challenging part of the vulnerability assessment was at first understanding the vulnerability report and how to interpret the different vulnerabilities flagged, however after a bit of research and guidance the report made sense and I could identify the false positives as well as critical areas such as plugin updates that needed to be updated in order to secure the system.

***How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?***<br>
To increase layers of security I made sure to run vulnerability tests in order to pick up and address any vulnerabilities that may occur during the system development process, in addition to that I also ensured to generate a self-signed certificate and secure the system with an SSL certificate to establish a secure connection.

In the future the mitigation techniques I would use and recommend are increasing layers of software security such as secure coding practices, secure design, regular vulnerability testing, patch management, access control, network security, and ongoing security monitoring.

***How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?***<br>
To make sure the software application was functional and secure I reviewed the vulnerability report and addressed the vulnerabilities that could be fixed by reviewing the code and modifying it as per the recommended solutions. I then did a secondary vulnerability test to make sure there were no new vulnerabilities introduced onto the system as well as ensure the code compiles and functions as expected.

***What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?***<br>
Some of the resources and tools I used were: OWASP, vulnerability scanning tools, dependency management tools such as Maven. I also used Authentication and access control measures to help limit access to sensitive data and systems. A coding practice that I would be frequent to use would be regularly updating software and applying security patches to help address any known vulnerabilities and protect against potential attacks.

***Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?***<br>
Some of the things I would show my future employers would be my coding portfolio for both project one and two as this will demonstrate technical growth on cyber security and building the project as well as the vulnerability assessment report which will show in detail my finding and proposed mitigation plan and the Artemis Financial Practices for Secure Software Report as this shows the steps I took and outcome to increase the layers of security in the software.
